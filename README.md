## A/B Testing

### Overview of Project

A/B testing project aims for understanding the e-commerce website by running A/B testing. The project goal was to help company decide whether they should stay with old implemented page or change to new page. For this project I used dataset that included group, landing page and converted rate. By using these dataset, I ran my A/B testing helped company to decided which page they should use.

 ### Conclusion of A/B testing result
According to the result we have, even after I added new factor the userâ€™s country did not effect conversion rate due to the fact that they were all exceeding significant level (0.05) which it means based on Type 1 error rate P value was greater than 0.05. Therefore we failed to reject the null hypothesis.
Additionally in part II, we also failed to reject the hypothesis due to exceeding P value of 0.906. Therefore we also concluded that old age was better or equally effective than the new page.

In conclusion, there is no reason to switch to new page when there is no significant evidence that new page is more effective to raise the conversation rate. At this point we should stay with old page because we failed to reject the null hypothesis.
